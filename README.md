# Palm Detection using YOLOv5

This repository contains code for palm detection using the YOLOv5 object detection framework. The dataset has been customized using Roboflow.

## Dataset Customization

The dataset for palm detection has been customized using Roboflow .

## Detection Model

The YOLOv5 model has been employed for palm detection. The repository includes two main code files:

1. **Training Code**: `palm_detection.ipynb` - Use this script to train the YOLOv5 model on the customized palm dataset.

2. **Inference Code**: `Counting.ipynb` - Implement this script to perform inference using the trained YOLOv5 model on new images .

## Pre-trained Model

The repository includes a 'weight' file containing the best weights of the trained model. This can be used for quick deployment and testing without the need for training.
